In the canvas of the evening sky,
A masterpiece begins to unfold high.
The sun, a molten globe of fire,
Descends with grace, a radiant pyre.

A palette of warm hues takes its cue,
Brushstrokes of gold and orange imbue.
Crimson whispers on the horizon's edge,
As daylight retreats, a silent pledge.

The clouds, like wisps of painted dreams,
Reflect the sun's departing gleams.
They dance in hues of pink and rose,
As the sun bids the day adieu, it chose.

A tranquil lake mirrors the celestial show,
As the sun dips, a soft, amber glow.
Silhouettes of trees, a darkened dance,
As nature orchestrates its twilight trance.

The world hushes in the sun's descent,
A celestial ballet, divine and content.
The day's farewell, a serene duet,
In the symphony of a sunset.
